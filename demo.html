            <span class="dropcap">C</span>all me Ishmael. Some years ago&mdash;never mind how long precisely&mdash;having
            little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
            shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
            the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
            circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever
            it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
            involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear
            of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
            upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
            from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
            people's hats off&mdash;then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
            as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical
            flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.
            There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
            in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
            towards the ocean with me.

            There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs&mdash;commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

            Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
            Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do
            you see?&mdash;Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
            thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some
            leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster&mdash;tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?
          </p>
          <p data-sg>
            But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
            seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
            extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
            warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as
            they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand&mdash;miles of them&mdash;leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys,
            streets and avenues&mdash;north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?

            Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
            almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries&mdash;stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.

            But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
            quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
            the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees,
            each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and
            here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder
            cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies&mdash;what is the one charm wanting?&mdash;Water&mdash;there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this
            is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of
            Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he
            saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the
            ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.

            Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick&mdash;grow quarrelsome&mdash;don't sleep of nights&mdash;do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;&mdash;no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,&mdash;though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board&mdash;yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;&mdash;though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.

            No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
            plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of honour, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.

          <p data-sg>
            What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
            and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I
            mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel
            Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and
            respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain't a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about&mdash;however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way&mdash;either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be content.

            Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying
            me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I
            ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there
            is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act
            of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two
            orchard thieves entailed upon us. But <i>being paid</i>,&mdash;what will compare
            with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really
            marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root
            of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.
            Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!

            Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise
            and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are
            far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate
            the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the
            quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the
            forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same
            way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same
            time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after
            having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it
            into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer
            of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs
            me, and influences me in some unaccountable way&mdash;he can better answer
            than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed
            part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time
            ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more
            extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run
            something like this:
          </p>
          <p data-sg>
            "<i>Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.</i>
            "WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. "BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN."
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p data-sg>It’s more an act of transference, of ideas and evocations hung around the vast and unknowable shape of the whale, an extended musing on the strange meeting of human history and natural history. It is, above all, a sui-generis creation, one that came into the world as an unnatural, immaculate conception.</p>
            <cite>Philip Hoare | <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-moby-dick-means-to-me">What “Moby-Dick” Means to Me</a></cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p data-sg>
            Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the
            Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others
            were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy
            parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces&mdash;though I cannot
            tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I
            think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being
            cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about
            performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it
            was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating
            judgment.
          </p>
          <p data-sg>
            Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
            himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity.
            Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the
            undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending
            marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to
            my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been
            inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for
            things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous
            coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and
            could still be social with it&mdash;would they let me&mdash;since it is
            but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one
            lodges in.
          </p>
          <p class="tombstone" data-sg>
            By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great
            flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that
            swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul,
            endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand
            hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
